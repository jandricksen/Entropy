To Do List:

**WORKING VERSION**

Change Collision call in ObjectLayer when object off map to some kind of virtual remove function
Check Rendering is efficient/map culling



Dismantle some of the Hanlders/Managers and most singletons. 
Replace pointers with address referncing
Get rid of Tiled system for now.

Make it so Bullets can't fly off end of Level
ADD FPS Counter
Devise a new Layer system that takes into account adding new game objects into rendering order/stack
Add a QuadTree System of Collision detection
Fix laser
 

Look at Scrolling Background Method of Moving Two rectangles
Understand tile collision in manager

Optimization: 

Go through and turn any uneccessary includes to forward declerations
Replace #define with consts
Replace #pragma once with #ifdef for cross compatibility
Rename RectRect method
Look at auto "ranged for loops" intead of defined for loops. for use with iterators (C++11 feature)
Clean up warnings
Change for loops to iterators 



Done:

1) Remove BulletHandler
2) Flesh our Bullet class to match other Actors
3) register a bullet type with the gameobject factory class and instantiate this (new Bullet.h etc) in Game.cpp. Then map1.tmx and levelparser can see this fucker
Find Map Width and Pass to Level
